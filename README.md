# Sierpinski Triangle with Recursion and p5.js

This repository contains the code and instructions for generating a Sierpinski triangle using recursion and p5.js. The code uses a `generatePoints()` function to recursively generate new points and draw lines between them, forming a Sierpinski triangle.

## Getting Started
